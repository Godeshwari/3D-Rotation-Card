🧠 How It Works

• The magic lies in CSS properties like:

• transform-style: preserve-3d; — for 3D depth

• rotateY() and translateZ() — to position each image in 3D space

• @keyframes animate — to create a continuous rotation effect

• -webkit-box-reflect — to add subtle reflections below each card


🎨 Customization

• Change translateZ(400px) in the CSS to adjust card spacing

• Update the --i variable for different rotation angles

• Replace Img1.jpg, Img2.jpg, etc. with your own images


💖 Made with passion for creativity, motion, and clean code.
